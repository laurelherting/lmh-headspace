GraphQL is a powerful query language
    Communicates between client and server
    Allows for a more flexible & efficient approach than REST

A restful approach:
1. Endpoint for getting a particular book:
    1. Domain.com/books/:id
        1. Title, genre, reviews, authorId
2. Endpoint for getting the author of that particular book:
    1. Domain.com/authors/:id
        1. Name, age, biography, bookIds
